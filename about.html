      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Hey, I’m Madeline — the hands behind MADFORJEWELS. I started this little business from my bedroom in Indonesia, driven by a simple love for creating and the belief that jewelry can be something more than decoration — it can be a voice.</p>
      <p>What began as wire, stones, and a curious heart has grown into something I’m truly proud of. Every piece you see here is handmade by me, wrapped with intention, and inspired by real people who want to wear something that means something.</p>

      <h2>Why I Do This</h2>
      <p>Jewelry is personal. It’s expression. It’s identity. And for too long, it’s also been overpriced or out of reach.</p>
      <p>I want to change that.</p>
      <p>MADFORJEWELS is about making handcrafted, unique jewelry that’s affordable, thoughtful, and honest. No factories, no mass production — just wire, tools, time, and love.</p>

      <h2>How It’s Made</h2>
      <p>Everything here is designed, crafted, and shipped by me, from my desk to your hands. I use quality wire, handpicked crystals and beads, and my favorite pair of pliers. Most pieces are one-of-a-kind or made in very limited batches — because I want you to wear something that feels as unique as you are.</p>
      <p>Got something special in mind? I also take custom orders. Let’s make your dream piece real.</p>

      <h2>The Look + The Vibe</h2>
      <p>My style is a mix of soft and strong — wire-wrapped with care, a little earthy, a little gothic, a little magical. Jewelry that speaks quietly but carries energy.</p>
